    "A **Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller (PID Controller)** is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems. A PID controller calculates an error value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process through use of a manipulated variable. The following photos show PID controllers used in the industry\n",

    "The PID controller algorithm involves three separate constant parameters, and is accordingly sometimes called **three-term control**: the proportional, the integral and derivative values, denoted $P$, $I$, and $D$. Simply put, these values can be interpreted in terms of time: $P$ depends on the ***present*** error, $I$ on the accumulation of ***past*** errors, and $D$ is a prediction of ***future*** errors, based on current rate of change. The weighted sum of these three actions is used to adjust the process via a control element such as the position of a control valve, a damper, or the power supplied to a heating element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of knowledge of the underlying process, a PID controller has historically been considered to be the most useful controller. By tuning the three parameters in the PID controller algorithm, the controller can provide control action designed for specific process requirements. The response of the controller can be described in terms of the responsiveness of the controller to an error, the degree to which the controller overshoots the setpoint, and the degree of system oscillation. Note that the use of the PID algorithm for control does not guarantee optimal control of the system or system stability.\n",

A PID controller will be called a $P$, $PI$, $PD$ or $PID$ controller in the absence of the respective control actions. $PI$ controllers are fairly common, since derivative action is sensitive to measurement noise, whereas the absence of an integral term may prevent the system from reaching its target value due to the control action.\n",

    "The objective of the simulation is to demonstrate the characteristics of $P$, $PI$, and $PID$ controllers on closed loop temperature control. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon using the $P$ controller, it shows a relatively quick response, but with an offset. At a higher $K_c$ value, the $P$ controller reacts faster but if it is too high, oscillatory behavior will start to show. Also, the higher the temperature deviation for the P controller, the less the error percentage, but it will take more time. As demonstrated in the simulation, this is the least favorable controller for temperature sensitive systems as it will take too long to correct the error and may lead to serious problems during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then with the $PI$ controller the reaction is ultimately oscillating (pseudostationary state) due to the slow response of the integral action. If the process has more time, the PI controller will eliminate the compensation and reach a new stable temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion is that the best type of controller is the $PID$ controller. Its response is faster than the $PI$ controller with less oscillation, thanks to the derivative controller, which fixes the response time to compensate for the slowness of its integral action. The integrated action also eliminates compensation, thus making the $PID$ controller a faster, less flickering and accurate controller for correcting any temperature-sensitive system."
