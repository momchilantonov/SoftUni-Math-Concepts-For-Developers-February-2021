    "### *3. Introduction of PID controller*\n",
    "A **Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller (PID controller)** is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems. A PID controller calculates an error value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process through use of a manipulated variable. The following photos show PID controllers used in the industry\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs\\PIDControllers.jpg\" width=500 hight=500 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The PID controller algorithm involves three separate constant parameters, and is accordingly sometimes called **three-term control**: the proportional, the integral and derivative values, denoted **P**, **I**, and **D**. Simply put, these values can be interpreted in terms of time: **P** depends on the ***present*** error, **I** on the accumulation of ***past*** errors, and **D** is a prediction of ***future*** errors, based on current rate of change. The weighted sum of these three actions is used to adjust the process via a control element such as the position of a control valve, a damper, or the power supplied to a heating element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of knowledge of the underlying process, a PID controller has historically been considered to be the most useful controller. By tuning the three parameters in the PID controller algorithm, the controller can provide control action designed for specific process requirements. The response of the controller can be described in terms of the responsiveness of the controller to an error, the degree to which the controller overshoots the setpoint, and the degree of system oscillation. Note that the use of the PID algorithm for control does not guarantee optimal control of the system or system stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some applications may require using only one or two actions to provide the appropriate system control. This is achieved by setting the other parameters to zero. A PID controller will be called a **P**, **PI** or **PD** controller in the absence of the respective control actions. PI controllers are fairly common, since derivative action is sensitive to measurement noise, whereas the absence of an integral term may prevent the system from reaching its target value due to the control action.\n",

    "PID **control theory** is a branch of mathematics and engineering with the purpose of modifying the behavior of a dynamic system with inputs (e.g. input from a temperature sensor) that changes over time. The main objective of control theory is stability. Usually, (in closed loop systems) stability is achieved by continually taking measurements and making adjustments to the system.\n",

The proportional, integral, and derivative terms are summed to calculate the output of the PID controller.

The reason is that it has no controller gain (affecting all three control modes), it has a proportional gain instead (affecting only the proportional mode). Adjusting the proportional gain should be supplemented by adjusting the integral and derivative settings at the same time. Try to not use this controller algorithm if possible (in some DCSs it is an option, so select the alternative).\n",

In contrast, a small gain results in a small output response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the proportional term should contribute to the bulk of the output change."
