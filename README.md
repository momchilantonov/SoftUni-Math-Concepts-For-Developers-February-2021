# Course details
If you are interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, then you probably already know that they are based on mathematics. Understanding basic mathematical principles such as linear algebra, probabilities, statistics and optimization is the first step towards understanding the logic behind a number of software solutions. Training can be a starting point for areas such as: algorithm design, data processing and analysis, programming for scientific purposes, machine learning, cryptography and more. It is also useful for people who are interested in mathematical foundations and methods and want to develop their logical thinking to support their skills as software developers. The main goal of the course is to build the foundation of mathematical knowledge that you need to start your career in the field of artificial intelligence. You will understand how to work with matrices and vectors, where and why complex numbers are used, how the derivative of a function has to do with speed, etc. In the lectures, new concepts and examples of their use in real life will be introduced, and during the practical classes they will be reinforced by writing code (in Python).
